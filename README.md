# BPMarketAnalysis 
A Casual Python Code to Analysis the current BP Market

Update: I learned a way to gather all the data I need, but I need to sort only what i need and to set up all current prizes + highest market prizes allowed by the game

Next Steps: 
1. Finish gathering all databases
2. Query a second dataframe with only those key sellable materials editing current database
3. Reshape entire logics behind Calculator, actually it only work using specific json in config folder. in the future it might be more dense
4. Improve scalar numpy method, probably I have to swicht to a more robust method.

Special Thanks to https://questlog.gg/blue-protocol/ I get all the data needed from them

Work in Progress. This is a personal project, feel free to copy
